# VRC-Voice-Booster
A simple voice booster script for VRChat that requires an object to interact with. You add the script to the object, give the object a collider with "Is Trigger?" enabled. Bada bing bada boom!

Udon Sharp v1.0+ Required For VoiceBoosterScript_V1.0 Simply put if you are using VRC Creator Companion you have Udon Sharp v1.0 or higher

Use VoiceBoosterScript_UdonClassic_V1.0 if you are using UdonSharpV0.20.x aka not using VRC Creator Companion yet [Consider updating your projects soon but as always make a backup]
